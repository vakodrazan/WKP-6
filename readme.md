# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant
 
## Another website about food, really...
 
Yes, but who doesn't like food? ðŸ˜„
 
This time, we're going to build a food delivery app, where we can see the meal options, select them, and see the result in our cart.
 
## structure of your project
 
 - I created an html inside of an html file but I only created the list in javascript because we need to return the value that is given in the array javascript. I use `forEach` to loop through each object.
 
 - We need to filter the type of food when the checkbox is checked. I use the `filter` method. Since it's an array I use map to loop through each one of them.
 
 - I filter them inside of an `if` statement because there is a condition I need to follow.
 
## What area of your work would you improve if I had more time?
 
 - I would carry on to work on the checkbox.
 - I would do my best to finish everything if I can.
 
## Anything new that I learn when I work on this project
 
 - Using `map` function and creating an html inside of it.
 - Before I didn't really understand how to use `forEach` but now I found that forEach is easier than `for` loop.
 
## the most challenging part I pass: 
 
 - I tried to work on the checkbox, it doesn't work when I use the statement, but when I tried to just call the function and use the true statement it works. Till now I couldn't find out how to solve that problem.
 - I spend most of my time on that.
 
## Explanation about a specific topic: 
 
 - I would like to know what condition I should use for the checkbox.
